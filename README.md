# CSD_AI

A script capable of beating the "stress" mode of Cook Serve Delicious 2, earning impossible achievments along the way! Currently, foods can be made in the holding stations according to priority (Required & Optional foods will only be made once, but all of them will be made), and served.

Because of some non-firstletter keybinds not being standard across recipes, and because natural language parsing is not included (i.e. there is no way to tell that Ground Meat = G. Meat = Grnd. Mt), some foods are incompatible. With vanilla keybinds, here are the supported recipes:
